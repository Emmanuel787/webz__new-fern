              Once upon a starry Caribbean night, I looked up to what I now know to be the Milky Way and I was mesmerized by the
              essence of the universe. It was the first time I recall experiencing my connection to it. I must have been 6 years old
              when this happened, and at that very moment, I knew that IT was calling me… Inviting me to reach it. This experience
              seeded the quest that literally defined the next several decades of my life; I had to find a way to “return home”… In my
              mind, that meant that I had to find a way to become an Astronaut!
            </p>
            <p class="chap-one-content">
              As a teenager, I kept that memory in the background of my mind. Then at age 16, an unexpected event blessed my life. It
              was at this young age that I first looked into the eyes of who came to be my only daughter; Jeilymar. As I admired her
              radiance, I instantly realized one truth with absolute conviction - that she could become whatever she desired, without
              limitations of any kind. Yet, here were the facts at the moment; I was a 16-year-old single mom, with an 11th grade
              education, limited resources, and absolutely no idea how to show her that indeed there are no limitations.

            Even though I deeply believed in her potential, the immediate question that came into my mind was: "How do I communicate
            this truth to her?" How?! Somehow the answer to my question resonated loudly into every fiber of my being.
          </p>
          <p class="chap-one-content">
            Here was the answer: You have to lead her with your example!
          </p>
          <p class="chap-one-content">
            That is how my own daughter, and my desire to connect to the Universe, became my two primary influencers. These two
            beautiful forces ignited my quest for purpose during the next 20 years of my life. I figured that if I became an
            astronaut, I would not only fulfill a deep desire to connect to the universe, but also as a byproduct, I could show my
            daughter via my own example that indeed anything is possible! That was the start of the most thrilling, the most
            courageous, the most uncertain adventure a 16-year-old single mom can imagine.
          </p>
          <p class="chap-one-content">
            Even though I had no idea what challenges I would encounter along the way, at least I knew where to start. As soon as I
            graduated from high school, I enrolled in college and dedicated my academic years to understanding the laws that govern
            our Universe. I eventually graduated with a B.Sci in Astrophysics, and a M.Sci in Mechanical Engineering from the
            University of Puerto Rico. A few years later, I also engaged in learning about the eccentricities of cognitive science
            and brain studies. This led to another degree, a M.Sci in Human Centered Design from the University of Washington – but
            we’ll talk about brain science and brain plasticity a bit later!

            In 2003, with a solid foundation of the sciences that govern our physical universe at hand, I on track to submit my
            Astronaut Candidate Application. That same year, as I was completing my first M. Sci degree, the Columbia Space Shuttle
            exploded and NASA announced they were going to end the space program as we knew it. Indeed, a few years later in 2010,
            the space shuttle was decommissioned and NASA started partnering with Russia in order to sustain the US space program
            that had started in the 1960s.
          </p>
          <p class="chap-one-content">
            When this happened, I seriously had to ask myself, “If I am not leaving this planet, then what inspires me to stay on
            it”? In all those years, I had never considered a plan B because I was that certain of my calling and my trajectory. I
            yearned to find a way to reconnect to my initial seed, a way to rekindle my passion and reconnect with that sense of awe
            and wonder that I felt when I was a child looking up at the stars. In my uncertainty of what to do next, I accepted one
            of the many job offers I had received in the area of military avionics. Yes, military avionics… not at all my childhood
            dream but it turns out that a degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering is a highly suitable background for building
            missiles. Who knew!

            My lack of greater awareness during my twenties led me to become a bit disillusioned about my connection to the
            Universe. It actually took me several years to find a plan B. Yet today, I am grateful that my search led to an
            extensive and colorful corporate career with over 15 years of experience in multiple fortune 500 enterprises such as
            NASA, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Skype, and Microsoft.

          <p class="chap-one-content">
            Even though I did not become a literal astronaut, I did find a hobby that allowed me to float like one! In retrospect,
            this could had been my first clue that indeed when we set our hearts and minds into something, with absolute conviction,
            the Universe conspires to help us reach our goals. In 2004 I became 1 of 9 crew members who helped start a company
            dedicated to opening space travel to civilians. The company is called Zero Gravity Corporation and we became NASA’s
            contractor to conduct microgravity experiments. I dedicated 12 years to this effort between 2004 and 2014, and although
            some of the founding members have moved on to pursue other goals, that company is still serving people today. You can
            book your own zero gravity flight at www.gozerog.com.

                By this time in my life, I felt that I had accumulating “enough evidence” to show here that we humans can indeed
                accomplish anything. However, even with all the external success, I could not find the inner peace that one would expect
                to find after completing a significant life goal. From my rational perspective, I had done everything I could to connect
                to the Universe, yet with all the knowledge of Physics, Astrophysics, and everyday mechanics I still felt disconnected.
                I just didn’t know what it was that I was disconnected from... But, deep inside, I felt empty. It felt like a sense of
                lack, a sense of purpose that was still missing; and had no idea where to search to quench the thirst I was secretly
                feeling inside.

              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                I imagined that perhaps I had spent too many years developing my analytical skills, and what I needed was to develop my
                softer, more creative skills. Was that possible? I didn’t know. It was just one of the many thoughts that kept me
                seeking.

                In 2011 I completed my second Master’s degree from the University of Washington. It was during this period of my life
                that I became aware of the growing evidence that debunked old understandings of our brain capacity. I learned that our
                brains are not actually static as we were taught to believe in the 80s and 90s. Neuroscientists like John Medina from
                the University of Washington and Joseph Delaux from New York University were two of many who were shining light into the
                power of our brains. I was discovering that in fact, our brains were so powerful and highly neuroplastic that we could
                even create a whole new identity as an adult if we so desired.

                Our brains are highly neuroplastic.

              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                Being a scientist myself, I decided to seriously experiment with this concept. In other words, I used myself as the
                subject to test the validity of our neuroplastic brains! One day, a thought entered my mind. “So far, I have been trying
                to show my daughter that indeed anything is possible, but what about completely changing paths as an adult? What if I
                start something I’ve never done before, something completely new to me, then attempt to be really good at it?”
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                It was with those thoughts and questions that I started to dance - at age 36! At that point in time I was a Program
                Manager at Microsoft during the day, and my daughter was attending college full time. That opened up a window of
                opportunity to do something different in my evenings. I took the opportunity to dedicate my nights and weekends to my
                first “brain re-wiring experiment”!

                I trained in Ballet, Contemporary, Ballroom, and I focused on Salsa as my primary form of dance. I still remember when
                my dance instructor Jhon Narvaez told me that one can become a decent dancer after about 3 years of good instruction and
                continuous commitment. I almost cried when I heard that because it was way too long for my standards! I am however, very
                grateful to my lack of patience because it actually came in very handy during this period! I honed into my discipline
                and I committed 5-6 nights of dance practice per week to train and rewire my brain. I figured that more time practicing
                would decrease the time period required to get better at my new skills. But, much to my chagrin, my dance instructor was
                right, and it did take me about 3 years to become competent at dancing – even with all the rigor and discipline I
                managed to muster. That fact still baffles me to this day, I haven’t yet understood why its not possible to become
                competent in a shorter amount of time… Apparently there are truly no shortcuts, but anyway, I digress. That will have to
                be a different research problem for another time…

              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                Back to the process of rewiring my brain. Like anything else we start new, I was pretty bad at dancing in the beginning.
                For months, I wasn’t sure if I was making much progress at all. Yet, slowly but surely, I was noticing an upward
                trajectory - especially when I compared my newer videos with those from the months prior. Indeed, I could tell that I
                moved differently, I also felt stronger, more fit, and younger. It was obvious that was literally signaling new genes in
                my body and that I was actually making new neurological pathways!

                As a good scientist, I needed evidence before calling the project a success. After all, my goal was to test the
                hypothesis all the way. I figured that I needed an objective third party to validate that indeed I was a competent
                dancer. Not that I didn’t trust my world champion dance instructor’s opinion, and that not that I didn’t trust my own
                subjective observations, but I figured that enrolling to compete would be a good objective measure.

                The great realization, I also call it my great satori awakening, happened six months prior to my completion. It was May
                15th of 2017 when my 19-year-old dance instructor Dhalia Lazcares dropped me off at the Oaxaca airport in Mexico. I had
                taken vacation time from Microsoft to spend two full weeks with her. She was helping me clean up my dance routine
                outside her school hours. One side note on Dhalia, do not let her young age distract you. This girl became a
                professional world champion dancer at age 12!

              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                After checking in for my flight I noticed that I had an eight-hour flight to get to Seattle. I figured it would be a
                good idea to download a book for the long flight. Via a series of coincidences, I ended up downloading a book that
                sounded interesting. It was called “Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself” by Dr Joe Dispenza. I downloaded it, got in
                the plane, and started to read it just as one starts to read any ordinary book. Yet I was about to find out that this
                was no ordinary book for me.

                Just as I opened it, still in chapter 1, it all happened. In a single instant, the words in that book illuminated a
                different vantage point for my entire life, including my own connection to the Universe. For the sake of simplicity, I
                will not go into the details of my realization here because I would have to dive into several Physics topics and we
                don’t have the space on this chapter to dive into that. But I will say the following, “Breaking the habit of being
                yourself” came into my life at the right time and in the right setting to help me realize the incredible power of the
                mind and body connection.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                Dr Joe Dispenza explains that we need to be coherent or in alignment, between how we think and how we feel in order to
                achieve our goals. When we are in alignment between our minds and our hearts, we generate a coherent or orderly signal
                that is then sent to our surrounding environment. On the contrary, when we are not in alignment between how we think and
                how we feel, we send out an incoherent or disorderly signal to our surrounding environment. This happens whether we are
                conscious of it or not.

              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                In that moment I realized how disciplined I had been with my dance training. For three years, I had been meticulous,
                diligent, and perseverant to learn a brand new skill; I was even in the middle of Mexico training with a 19-year-old
                high schooler for heaven sake. Yet, even though I trained like a dancer, and I looked like a dancer, I did not feel like
                a dancer. In my heart I was full of doubt. I had no idea who I would compete with, but it was likely that whomever would
                show up to a world stage, she surely must have been a dancer for a lot longer than me. Who knows, maybe she had been
                dancing since she was a child. These thoughts and feelings were lingering in my subconscious mind.

                The relevant note to make here is that even though I was fully onboard with my mind, my feelings were telling a
                different story. I was producing incoherent signals between my mind and my feelings, and If I showed up to compete with
                that state of being, my own energy could unintentionally sabotage my competition. Regardless of how much I trained my
                technique.

              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                I evaluated Dr Joe’s claims against my past successes. I had practically succeeded in everything I ever set my mind
                into. If he was right about mind and body coherence, then why didn’t I fail more often when I was not aware of what I
                was emitting energetically? The answer popped into my head loud and clear. I succeeded because every fiber of my being
                desired nothing more than to show my daughter Jeilymar that anything was possible. In other words, I was always
                signaling a coherent message even when I was not conscious about it. The dance experiment was different because Jeilymar
                was not the main motivator for my new endeavor. After she started college, I was just experiencing life and testing new
                grounds with a completely different motivation.

                The premise of Dr Joes’s claims made complete sense to me, and so, I had to address the incoherent signals I was
                sending
                out to the Universe. The good news is that the completion was still six months away, and I was well equipped with the
                discipline and tools I needed to conduct a second experiment. This is when I started meditating and introspecting to
                align myself between how I acted externally, and how I felt inside.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                Fast forward to December 2017. I still remember the moment when I walked up to the stage for my final run. I took a
                moment to sit with my emotions and I recall thinking the following: “I do not need a title to tell me that I am a
                dancer, because regardless of what the judges say, I already feel that I won. Yet, if I do win, I have to share what I
                have discovered with as many people as I can”. I then surrendered the outcome to the Universe and proceeded to perform
                my two-minute routine.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                What happened during those two minutes was a bit surreal. Even with the high stakes of performing in front of world
                class judges, there was no stress, no pressure, I was simply free.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                This state of peak performance and flow was such a different experience for me, that it actually felt wrong. After I
                walked off the stage, I told my dance instructor Jhon that I had entered sort of dream state and I know I did not
                perform as I usually did; under stress and pressure to do well. To my surprise Jhon responded with the following words
                “Keep walking Fernmarie, that was your best run ever”.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                The next day the judges presented us with a first-place trophy at the World Latin Dance Cup.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                And so i started my Journey to the Unknown
                A few months later I quit my job, quit my dance team, sold my home and ventured off to understand more about meditation,
                introspection. I have spent the last two and a half years re-thinking, re-calibrating, re-evaluating my purpose, my
                career, and my approach to life. I can write an entire book just to describe the magic that I have witnessed since then,
                but that will certainly be a story for another time.
              </p>
              <p class="chap-one-content-mf2">
                For now, I will leave you with this; The moment we start to master our internal state, that is the moment that we start
                living life to its fullest.
